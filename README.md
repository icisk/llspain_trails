# I-CISK - LL Spain


## Quick start

Ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 18 or later) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Version 9.x) installed.

Then execute the following commands to get started:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/icisk/llspain_trails.git # Clone this repository
cd llspain_trails
pnpm install                                          # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev                                          # Launch development server
```

Vite will print the project's local address (usually <http://localhost:5173/>).
Point your browser at it and start programming!
