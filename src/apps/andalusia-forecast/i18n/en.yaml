    nav: 6-Month Forecast Maps
    heading: Medium-term monthly weather forecasts (up to 6 months)
    heading_descr: 'This service provides seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature for the next six months. The maps show the 50th percentile of 51 forecast members, with bias correction at the seasonal level followed by multiple linear regression and residual interpolation, at a spatial resolution of 231m. By selecting a pixel, a time series with percentiles 5 to 95 is displayed to facilitate uncertainty analysis.'
